# Learning outcomes
1.   Explain Boyer-Moore Algorithm as a solution of pattern pre-processing
2.   Explain the techniques of text pre-processing, including tries, compressed tries, and suffix tries
3.   Understand the concept of Greedy Method and explain the construction of Huffmanâ€™s Algorithm



# Readings

*   Chapter 13.1-13.2.2, 13.3, and 13.4 of the textbook



# Workshop: Text Processing

## Discussion

*   **[R-13.4*]** Draw a figure illustrating the pattern matching for the text "aaabaadaabaaa" and pattern "aabaaa" done by the Boyer-Moore algorithm.



*   **[R-13.8]** Draw a standard trie for the following set of strings: 
    { abab, baba, ccccc, bbaaaa, caa, bbaacc, cbcc, cbca }.



*   **[R-13.9]** Draw a compressed trie for the strings given in the previous problem.



*   **[R-13.11]** Draw the frequency array and Huffman tree for the following string: "dogs do not spot hot pots or cats".



*   **[C-13.39]** A native Australian named Anatjari wishes to cross a desert carrying only a single water bottle. He has a map that marks all the watering holes along the way. Assuming he can walk k miles on one bottle of water, design an efficient algorithm for determining where Anatjari should refill his bottle in order to make as few stops as possible. Argue why your algorithm is correct.

**Hint:** Anatjari should use a greedy algorithm.



## Implementation

* **Task 2 assignment**.
